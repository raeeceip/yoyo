    "title": "The Mandelbrot Set",
    "description": "The Mandelbrot set is one of the most famous examples of fractals in mathematics.",
    "formula": {
        "explanation": "The Mandelbrot set is defined by a simple recursive equation in the complex plane:",
        "equation": "f(z) = z^2 + c\nwhere z and c are complex numbers"
    },
    "history": "The Mandelbrot set is named after Benoit Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it in 1975. However, it was first visualized by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski in 1978. Mandelbrot studied the set in detail and published his findings in 1980.",
    "interestingFacts": [
        "The Mandelbrot set is infinitely complex, yet it's generated by an extremely simple equation.",
        "Zooming into the Mandelbrot set reveals an infinite amount of detail, with smaller copies of the entire set appearing at various scales.",
        "The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is where Julia sets are connected for the corresponding c value.",
        "Despite its complex appearance, the Mandelbrot set is a connected set, meaning it's all one piece.",
        "The Mandelbrot set has become a popular subject in mathematical art and has been called 'the thumbprint of God'."
