    "title": "The Burning Ship Fractal",
    "description": "The Burning Ship fractal is a variant of the Mandelbrot set, known for its distinctive flame-like appearance.",
    "formula": {
        "explanation": "The Burning Ship fractal is defined by a modification of the Mandelbrot set equation, where the absolute value is taken before squaring:",
        "equation": "f(z) = (|Re(z)| + i|Im(z)|)^2 + c\nwhere z and c are complex numbers"
    },
    "history": "The Burning Ship fractal was discovered by Michael Michelitsch and Otto E. RÃ¶ssler in 1992. It's a relatively recent addition to the family of fractals derived from the Mandelbrot set.",
    "interestingFacts": [
        "The fractal gets its name from its resemblance to a burning ship with smoke billowing from it.",
        "Unlike the Mandelbrot set, the Burning Ship fractal is not symmetric about the x-axis.",
        "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set appears as a triangular shape in the Burning Ship fractal.",
        "Zooming into the Burning Ship fractal reveals intricate structures that often resemble feathers or ferns.",
        "The Burning Ship fractal demonstrates how small changes to the generating function can produce dramatically different fractals."
